# subshot
subshot is a bash script tool that will take a given domain and enumerate the subdomains using the popular tool subfinder and then it will filter out the live subdomains using httpx

The final subdomains will be presented to the user in a txt file for further analysis

This tool will streamline web pentesting engagements and bug bounty hunting by allowing ethical hackers to filter out valuable subdomains to work on rather than manually checking the original subdomains.

This tool also streamlines the subdomain recon process as the ethical hacker does not need to run subfinder and httpx manually in the terminal which can cost time, especially over working with many targets.
